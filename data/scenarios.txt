Triangulum;Triangulum;Inside the Triangulum Galaxy lies a solar system buzzing with life. All this life amazingly arose independently on all of the 7 different planets, and until recently, these different life forms knew nothing about eachother's existence. But that all changed, when the top scientists of the planet Caoutchouc invented the Interplanetary Teleportation Device, allowing for fast and easy transportation between the 7 planets. A giant cultural shock hit the entire solar system. Looting and robbing between planets became a major problem after the ITD became the standard traveling method, it was clear that something had to be done. A council was created with representatives from each planet, and they quickly ensured the immediate destruction of all ITDs and relevant research. A decision which is now mostly looked at as rushed, unnecessary and generally bad. Begging people to start questioning who these representatives really are, and how they got so much power. All of this is going on, while a little newly started delivering company based on the planet Decapod 10 struggles with everyday economics and late deliveries, only held up by their top delivery guy: Bender. Which is why they hired you. You start on monday.
