Our fellow rebel camp on Meilleur's moon has an important item that will help us win our quest to conquer Caoutchouc, and once again be in charge of our solar system. We sent an agent there nearly a month ago, but he hasn't returned. Please, will you help us?

yes
Great! Please take this package with you to Meilleur's moon and get the object, only you can save us now, Handsome ;-)
