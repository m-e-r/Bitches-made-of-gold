wow
If you buy fuel at the station right over there *points to the right of him*, you can warp around within this system, which will cost you no time. LISTEN!!! If you fly to a planet with war without papers and warp, you are dead son! So if there is war at a planet! Either warp to the planet or get your papers done!

But, buying warp fuel costs you reputation, people don't like people that are warping around, so be use the fuel wisely!
